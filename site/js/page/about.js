            <p>My road to become one was fairly long. Having many varied interests, I studied psychology, food technology and electronics.
                I didn't finish any of them, continuously expanding my general knowledge, 
                exploring various paths and searching for the craft to which I will want to commit for the long haul and put all my heart into it.
                In the meantime, I held various odd jobs. Among them were work in a construction,
                paper carton production, electronics production, on a peony plantation, as a postman, bodyguard and a
                warehouseman. Having interests as different as philosophy, history, economics, geopolitics, weightlifting,
                dietetics, engineering and hard sciences, pushed me to try various things to
                find what fits my character and abilities best. In 2017, after year of studying electronics
                at the Lodz University of Technology I got a programming internship at Inovatica in Lodz. Already before
                that opportunity I developed fondness for programming. I did well there,
                so taking the risk, negotiating and getting employed was the next, natural step for me. Not long after that, I dropped
                out of university and created rigorous plan of learning, which I had been executing zealously since then.
                From there onwards, my real journey as programmer has began.</p>
            <p>From September 2017 to November 2019 I worked as a programmer for Inovatica in Lodz.
                At the very begining developing native Android applications was my only responsibility. Not long after
                that, I was using Spring and Hibernate to create various backend services.
                There was also a period when I was working on very customized and
                domain specific Java applications that were interacting with <a href="http://www.ros.org">ROS</a> (Robot Operating System).
                From the very first days of my career, I was relucatant to specialize. 
                There is a burning desire in me to know and understand everything, and to acquire as much skills as possible.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, I worked for <a href="https://www.hycom.pl">Hycom</a>.
                At at the very begining, I was involved in creating data lake, dealing with collecting and analyzing large amounts of data and
                building infrastructure that makes it possible.
                My responsibilities range from writing custom Java and Python applications to managing CI/CD pipelines, automating repeating tasks,
                optimizing databases performance or even performing data analysis, occasionally. Again, not long after that, I got involved in working on Java and microservices based system. 
                Seeing the whole picture of complex systems, being able to understand, design and implement their various parts is something that gives me tremendous ammount of joy.
            </p>
            <p>Then, I was a Backend Engineer in <a href="https://weareuncapped.com">Uncapped</a>, where things are moving rather fast.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am working with my brother on our own idea, which will be public soon: <a href="http://hairo.io">hairo.io</a>.
            <p>Programming is my greatest passion, so I am
                always learning and working on various <a href="/code">projects</a>.
                I consider myself a programmer, not only web, desktop or mobile one. A problem solver, would perhaps be better description of me.
                I am not married to any technology, language or framework. Most of my <a href="experience">experience</a> is related to
                web development <a href="skills">using</a> Java and JavaScript related technologies.
                Due to my work for Hycom and various side projects, I also have become proficient in Python.
                Nevertheless, I am constantly expanding my expertise, always seeking for new knowledge and skills. 
                Thinking about better ways of solving various problems is something deeply ingrained in my nature. 
                Being on this path for so long, I can't and don't want to stop improving myself, in every possible way.
            </p>
