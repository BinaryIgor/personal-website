        I worked on their set of products, both internal and client facing.
        Most important technologies/paradigms used were: Java 17, Spring Boot, microservices, <a href="https://www.jooq.org/">JOOQ</a>, GCP, BigQuery, <a href="https://dataform.co/">dataform</a>, Kubernetes and <a href="https://fluxcd.io/">Flux</a>.

        Once again, I am not really sure microservices were needed here. Without them (and with modular monolith), the system could be a lot, a lot simpler.`,

         All of them were containerized and deployed on AWS, making heavy use of cloud infrastructure, including RDS, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, ECS and S3.
         Due to heavy usage of time series data, we later on switched from RDS to a customized <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a> instance, deployed on EC2.
         Applications were written in <strong>both Java and Python</strong>. 
         Among others, technologies used were: Spring Boot, <a href="https://www.jooq.org/">JOOQ</a>, Spark, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> and <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">Testcontainers</a>.`,

            Facing all of its downsides and enjoying some of the benefits. 
            At my current level of knowledge and experience, I think that, for the most part, costs of using this architecture outweigh benefits. 
            It shouldn't be used, unless such a need <strong>could be objectively, logically and empirically proven</strong>.
            Most of its benefits, without downsides, could be obtained using <a href="https://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/modular-monolith-primer/">modular monolith</a> approach.
            Besides, let's not forget about the YAGNI principle. 
            The absolute majority of our systems is not the next Facebook, Youtube, Netflix or Google and it will never have problems of their scale.`,
        "Tests": `Almost every application that I have created/modified here, had very high test coverage (70%, often 80% and more). 
            We write both unit and integration tests, in both Python and Java applications.
            After this experience and experimenting with many side projects, I will never write anything of importance without focusing on tests and testability first.
            I have also encountered many drawbacks of heavy reliance on mocking. 
            Due to all of that, my approach to tests has evolved and is now very similar to one

        "DevOps": `<del>Taking care and improving existing CI/CD infrastructure. 
            It was based on Jenkins and used a host of Bash, Python, SQL and Ansible scripts.</del> 
            We rewrote the CI/CD system from scratch, using a combination of Python scripts and AWS's CodeBuild service, automating everything that could be automated.
            Due to the growing number of applications and limited team size, we also decided to automate (as much as possible) maintenance and monitoring.
            Our custom monitoring system was based on: <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, Elasticsearch, CloudWatch and a dedicated Python application.`
